# GIS-in-R
This repository contains the code I used to create my project for the completion of the GIS in R course by Jasper Slingsby.

# About the Map
The map produced by the code in this repo is meant to plot iNaturalist seal carcass observations against the occurence of rabies outbreaks and the distance from surrouding seal colonies. Seal colony data was taken from Kirkman (2012) and Maja (2024).
